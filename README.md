# OVERVIEW

This project emails the development of a time series model using an LSTM architecture to predict Tesla stock market highs. The model employs historical data with using batch normalization and dropout layers to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. The model is trained and validated, using metrics such as RMSE to assess its predictive performance. In addition, the model is applied to a different dataset, BTC-USD, to forecast its market highs. Hence by evaluating its accuracy using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE, the model's versatility and effectiveness across diverse data sets are demonstrated. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and tuning, followed by extensive validation and performance evaluation. This thorough method confirms the model's capacity to precisely forecast market trends within diverse time series datasets, furnishing valuable insights to inform potential investment choices.

# TECHNICAL DETAILS
In recent times, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have become a integral approach for handling sequential data such as stock prices, given their unique ability to capture complex temporal dependencies (Chung and Shin, 2018). LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for their capacity to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data (Lipton et al., 2015). Since its introduction by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997, LSTMs have since been applied to numerous domains, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting (Van Houdt et al., 2020). Basically, what distinguishes LSTMs from other RNNs is their memory cell architecture, which allows them to selectively retain or forget information based on input gates, output gates, and forget gates (Abdullrhman et al., 2021). Consequently, this capability makes LSTMs well-suited for tasks like stock price prediction, where long-range dependencies are common (as used in this study).

Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of LSTM models in financial forecasting. A study by Ali et al. (2021) showed that LSTMs could outperform traditional financial models such as logistic regression and support vector machines when forecasting stock price movements. They emphasized the significance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in enhancing the efficacy of the model. In a study by Bhandari et al (2020), LSTM models were employed for predicting daily closing prices of major stock indices. Their results indicated that LSTMs performed better than conventional models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and support vector regression (SVR). They also explored the combination of LSTM with wavelet transform to enhance the model's ability to capture non-linear patterns in the data.
 
Further, an essential aspect of time series forecasting is data preprocessing, in practice, data must often be detrended and normalized to improve model performance and stabilize learning. In light of this, Wibawa et al. (2024) compared different data normalization techniques in LSTM models and found that min-max scaling often yields the best results for time series forecasting. In addition to LSTM models, other deep learning architectures have also been explored in financial forecasting. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used in combination with LSTMs to enhance feature extraction from time series data (Karim et al., 2017). However, CNNs excel at capturing local patterns and trends, while LSTMs handle long-term dependencies (Wang et al., 2023). Consequently, the hybrid CNN-LSTM approach has been found to improve the accuracy of forecasts in some cases.

Furthermore, studies have investigated the impact of ensemble methods on financial forecasting. Thus, by combining the outputs of multiple models, ensemble approaches can increase robustness and stability. Studies by Wang et al. (2018) and others have shown that ensemble methods can improve forecast accuracy by aggregating the strengths of individual models. While deep learning models like LSTMs have shown great promise in time series forecasting, challenges like the interpretability of these models are imminent (Su et al., 2024). Since deep neural networks function as black boxes, understanding how the model arrives at a specific prediction can be difficult.
However, data scientists are exploring techniques such as attention mechanisms and model- agnostic methods to address this concern. In addition, time series data often exhibit characteristics like seasonality, trends, and outliers, which require careful handling during preprocessing and modelling (Alexandropoulos et al., 2019). Consequently, advanced techniques such as seasonal decomposition of time series data and rolling window analysis are utilized to account for these factors.

Finally, it is essential to acknowledge the importance of evaluating model performance comprehensively. Frequently employed measures encompass mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). These metrics offer understanding into the accuracy, precision, and bias of the model.
